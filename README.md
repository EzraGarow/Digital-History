## Course Description

This hybrid 4xx/5xx course will offer a workshop setting to advance practical and theoretical approaches to Digital History. Digital History is an approach to examining and representing the past that makes extensive use of computational technologies for research, analysis, interpretation, composition, and communication. All history projects are now digital, although some more than others, and some taking a more self-critical and self-aware approach. Students will be introduced to the ways in which digital technologies have altered, and are altering, the historical profession, while also showing the value of taking a critical approach to digital methods. Students will also gain practical, hands-on knowledge of certain digital technologies and methods.

Digital History is not a normal fields-course that prepares students for historiographical knowledge. Rather, it balances historiography with technical and computational training. The merger of historiography and computational techniques are showcased by your individual projects.

DH is a large field. This year, the course will be focusing on data, data analysis, and data visualizations. We will also be using GitHub as a central hub to which we will push our work and from which we will pull to a personal website.

This course is a 4-credit course, which means that in addition to the scheduled meeting times, students are expected to do at least 9.5 hours of course-related work outside of class each week during the semester. This includes time spent completing assigned readings, participating in discussion sessions, studying for tests and examinations, preparing written assignments, and other course-related tasks.
