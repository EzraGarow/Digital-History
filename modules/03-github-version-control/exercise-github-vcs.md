# Exercise for M03 2024-02-05

This exercise has two parts, which should both be completed by end of day 2024-02-11

## Part I &ndash; Git Work

- clone the bds134/digital-history repo in VSCode
- clone your repo for your Git Page in VSCode; invite me (bds134) to collaborate
- create a dh-term-paper repo; invite me (bds134) to collaborate; and set up a workspace for it in VSCode
- create a my-pro-webpage repo; invite me (bds134) to collaborate; and set up a workspace for it in VSCode

## Part II &ndash; Personal Page Work

You are going to do some research and thinking and writing about personal webpages for professional activities. Record your research & thoughts in a Markdown file in the my-pro-webpage repo. Find and cite two sites that you think might act as models, in whole or part, for your own site. Add a README file to declare the purpose of the repo and to describe the resources you add. Add another Markdown file that describes the goals of your site, the site-map of your site, and that offers some thoughts on (and rationale for) your proposed design of the site. This is a very preliminary description of your site, so don't worry if it needs to be revamped. Be ready to talk about your ideas next Monday 2024-02-12.
