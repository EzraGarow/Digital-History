## Commit Options

There are three options for committing changes:

1. Commit: Records changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
2. Commit (amend): Modifies the most recent commit.
3. Commit & Push: Does the above and pushes it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
4. Commit & Sync: Does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.
