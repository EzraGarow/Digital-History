This table serves as a quick reference to all the cmdlets discussed in this lesson. The first column shows the actual name; the second shows what you will normally type instead. The Bash equivalent shows the most similar command in Bash. Unless this command is in parentheses, it can also be used in PowerShell as an alias for the corresponding cmdlet. (Linux and OS X users, please see the note below.) For a more complete explanation of any of the cmdlets, use Get-Help with the -online parameter (e.g. Get-Help Get-ChildItem -online.)

| Cmdlet | Alias | Bash Equivalent | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Get-ChildItem | gci | ls | List the directories and files in the current location. |
| Set-Location | sl | cd | Change to the directory at the given path. Typing .. rather than a path will move up one directory. |
| Push-Location | pushd | pushd | Changes to the directory. |
| Pop-Location | popd | popd | Changes back to the previous directory after using pushd |
| New-Item | ni | (touch) | Creates a new item. Used with no parameter, the item is by default a file. Using mkdir is a shortcut for including the parameter -ItemType dir. |
| mkdir | none | mkdir | Creates a new directory. (See New-Item.) |
| Explorer | none | (open) | Open something using File Explorer (the GUI) |
| Remove-Item | rm | rm | Deletes something. Permanently! |
| Move-Item | mv | mv | Moves something. Takes two arguments - first a filename (i.e. its present path), then a path for its new location (including the name it should have there). By not changing the path, it can be used to rename files. |
| Copy-Item | cp | cp | Copies a file to a new location. Takes same arguments as move, but keeps the original file in its location. |
| Write-Output | write | echo | Outputs whatever you type. Use redirection to output to a file. Redirection with >> will add to the file, rather than overwriting contents. |
| Get-Content | gc | cat | Gets the contents of a file and prints it to the screen. Adding the parameter -TotalCount followed by a number x prints only the first x lines. Adding the parameter -Tail followed by a number x prints only the final x lines. |
| Select-String | sls | (grep) | Searches for specific content. |
| Measure-Object | measure | (wc) | Gets statistical information about an object. Use Get-Content and pipe the output to Measure-Object with the parameters -line, -word, and -character to get word count information. |
| > | none | > | Redirection. Puts the output of the command to the left of > into a file to the right of >. |
| \| | none | \| | Piping. Takes the output of the command to the left and uses it as the input for the command to the right. |
| Get-Help | none | man | Gets the help file for a cmdlet. Adding the parameter -online opens the help page on TechNet. |
| exit | none | exit | Exits PowerShell |

Remember the keyboard shortcuts of tab for auto-completion and the up and down arrows to scroll through recent commands. These shortcuts can save a lot of typing!

A note to Linux and OS X users: Although many Bash commands work in PowerShell, they often donâ€™t do exactly the same thing. They may take different parameters, and the syntax may be slightly different. (Technically, they never do the same thing, as PowerShell commands produce objects, whereas Bash commands produce text.) However, the similarity of their actions offers a handy crutch for quickly getting up and running with PowerShell, and a little help from the Get-Help cmdlet (you can just type man like in Bash) will usually resolve any confusion.
