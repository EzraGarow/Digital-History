# Visual Studio Code, Command Line Interface, and Markdown Basics

In this lesson, you will learn some basic tools that allow you do practice minimalist computing.

## Visual Studio Code

An Integrated Development Environment is a place where you can write, push, and pull code. Visual Studio Code is a free IDE that is now owned and managed by Microsoft. It is also a wonderful text editor and file management system that can handle everything that a Historian needs. You can write rich text documents; man           age files and directories (i.e. folders); view images and combine them with text; write basic code for a number of languages to manage any public (or private) websites or webpages; compose, edit and manage tabular data, be they in 'flat' sheets or relational databases; practice version control through connectivity with sites such as GitHub; and manage servers and server-hosted databases. Best of all, VSC offers an interface that is free of many graphical distractions, letting you focus on writing.
